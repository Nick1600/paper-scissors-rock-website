#Paper Scissors Rock Game
-------------------------

This is a personal project using HTML, CSS and JS. This was mostly straight forwards for me. I did find adding the win/loss counters a nice challenge though. I am sure that there are more efficient ent ways to layout the JS. Maybe I'll refine it one day when I have a bit more know-how. I am pretty happy with how it turned out, but any feedback would be more than welcome.

Thanks!

Nick.
